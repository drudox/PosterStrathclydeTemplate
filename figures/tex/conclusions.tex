% Summarise the findings of your study and highlight the limitations. Be positive but realistic about the results. This section should be no more than 1 page.

During the first year of the project entitled ``Direct numerical Simulation of Turbulent Polymeric Flow'' 
the single polymer-chain in a homogenous isotropic turbulent flow was investigated. 

The polymers exhibit to interact with the turbulent eddies when a single eddy interacts with them, shown that a single chain is free to stretch until the end of life of the turbulent eddy. 

Due to the long duration of understanding the computational code used (high complexity of code structure),
the time necessary to understand the theory behind the polymer in turbulent liquid flow, and the very long time of simulation (sometimes one month), it is not yet possible to draw satisfactory conclusions. 

But as reported in the Future Works Chapter until the end of this year our aim is to be able to better understand the stretching phenomena studied, in order to predict it and verify the different between low concentration (single chain) and higher chains concentration, to investigate the behaviour in presence of entanglements situation is planned as well.

The plan for the future years has been reported and we will complete our goals, continuing the progress in 
this project until reach very high level of ability and knowledge.
